    <p>This Implementation Guide uses FHIR defined resources â€“ Composition Resource, Questionnaire Resource,
    QuestionnaireResponse Resource, Patient Resource, PractitionerRole Resource, Practitioner Resource, Organization Resource, ServiceRequest Resource and Bundle Resource from
    FHIR R4. For details on HL7 FHIR R4 see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The CH Electronic Transition of Care (CH eTOC) Implementation Guide describes how forms for eReferrals from one healthcare provider to another (e.g. paratctioner to hospital, hospital to hospital etc.), 
    shall be defined, deployed and used in order to achieve a syntactical and semantically consistent cross enterprise information exchange.
    </p>
    <p>The Implementation Guide relies on FHIR e.g. the questionnaire resource. Because the Implementation Guide relies heavily on the FHIR Resources Questionnaire and
    QuestionnaireResponse, forms are addressed here as Questionnaires.
    </p>
    <p>This Implementation Guide is derived from the Order &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide  
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/ehealthsuisse/ch-orf/">CH-ORF</a> which relies on HL7 Structured Data Capture Implementation Guide, see
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/">SDC IG</a> and uses the Swiss Core Profiles, see 
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-core/index.html">CH Core</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Applications claiming for conformance with the eTOC Implementation Guide shall:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Render (and in case of the Questionnaire filler allow for data entry) all elements of a questionnaire in the
        user interface (e.g. on screen, in print). Grouping of items and the order of items within shall be adequately
        reproduced according to the Questionnaire.</li>
        <li>Be able to process all MUST SUPPORT items.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Venders of applications with Questionnaire Filler/Questionnaire Receiver Actors are strongly recommended to implement
    interfaces to other applications (such as HIS and PACS) for all MUST SUPPORT items.
    <a name="volume1"></a><h3>Content Modules</h3>
    </p>
    <p>This Implementation Guide covers the content of CH eTOC based on CH-ORF. CH eTOC is intended for use in directional communication
    as well as for the use in the SWISS EPR.  
    </p>
   <p> Actors, transactions and security considerations are covered in the corresponding sections of 
      <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/ehealthsuisse/ch-orf/">CH-ORF</a>

    <a name="volume3"></a><h4>Questionnaire Content</h4>
    <p>This section describes the content of a form. The following definitions apply:
    </p>
    <p>Request and responses consist of filled in questionnaires. Some elements of the questionnaire are generic 
        elements (such as author, data entry person, receiver etc. and are always present in a questionnaire compliant to
        the ORF Implementation Guide. In addition, a questionnaire will contain elements which are dependent on particular needs of 
        the addressed use cased. Those eleements are named Healthcare Domain Specific Elements.

    <a name="volume1"></a><h4>Generic elements of a questionnaire</h4>
    <p>A questionnaire shall have a set of generice elements (e.g. author, data entry person, receiver etc.
