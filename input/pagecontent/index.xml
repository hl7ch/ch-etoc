     <a name="volume1"></a><h4>Purpose</h4>

    <p>The CH eTransition of Care (CH eTOC) Implementation Guide defines the content of a referral from a GP to the hospital, to a specialist,
    from one hispital to another etc.
    </p>

    <p>CH eTOC is intended for use in directional communiation as well as for the use in the SWISS EPR.
    </p>  

  <a name="volume1"></a><h4>Foundation</h4>
    
    <p>This Implementation Guide uses FHIR defined resources. For details on HL7 FHIR R4 see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4</a>
    </p>

    <p>Because the Implementation Guide relies heavily on the FHIR Resources Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse, forms are addressed here as Questionnaires.
    </p>
    
    <p>This Implementation Guide is derived from the Order &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide  
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-orf/index.html">CH-ORF</a> which relies on HL7 Structured Data Capture Implementation Guide, see
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/">SDC IG</a> and uses the Swiss Core Profiles, see 
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-core/index.html">CH Core</a>
    </p>

    <p>Applications claiming for conformance with the CH eTOC Implementation Guide shall:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Render (and in case of the Questionnaire filler allow for data entry) all elements of a questionnaire in the user interface
            (e.g. on screen, in print).</li> 
            
            <li>For Clinical Information: Grouping of items and the order of items within shall be adequately reproduced according to the Questionnaire.</li>
        </ul>
   
   <p>This Implementation Guide adheres to the FHIR International Patient Summary (IPS) Implementation Guide. Clinical content uses
    mostly the same resources as th IPS; some minor differences are explained in comments to the resources affected. The resouce definitions 
    are however constrained from FHIR base definitions and Swiss Core definitions and NOT from UVIPS. 
    This decision was made in order to minimize unexpected impact of future changes in IPS and for compatibility with 
    Swiss Core. eToc adds a ServiceReequest resource to the clinical content (according to the IPS) in order to depict the reason for a referral, the requested 
    service and some additional information (e.g. coverage, room preferance etc.). Resources for such purpose are referenced by the ServiceRequest
    resource. Header information such as sender, receiver etc. are condsidered as Generic Elements (to all sorts of referral, orders etc.) 
    and follow the definition in the ORF Implementation Guide.  

    This IG follows the Swiss eHealth Exchange Format Handbook Part I: Service Requests V 0.13. The Questionnaire resource gives gudiance for 
    the implementaion of the user interface.</p>

    <p>As a consequence of this decision, the first version of CH eTOC does not claim to be confromant to IPS.
    </p>
    
    <p> Actors, transcations and security considerations are covered in the corresponding sections of 
        <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-orf/index.html">CH-ORF</a>
