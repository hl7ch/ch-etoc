<p>This profile represents the constraints applied to the AllergyIntolerance resource by the International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR Implementation Guide. A record of an allergy or intolerance is represented in the patient summary as an instance of an AllergyIntolerance resource constrained by this profile.</p>
<p>It documents the relevant allergies or intolerances (conditions) for a patient, describing the kind of reaction (e.g. rash, anaphylaxis,..); preferably the agents that cause it; and optionally the criticality and the certainty of the allergy.</p>
