Patient S. Ufferer h### Radiology Order
We have the following players:

* Order placer: Health professional Dr. O. Rderplacer who is a GP in group practice “Happy Doctors”
* Order filler: Surgical department of “Happy Hospital”
* Patient: Mr. S. Ufferer who needs a surgical intervention.

Patient S. Ufferer has an appointment with Dr. O. Rderplacer: He agrees with the patient that some surgery is necessary which will be made at the surgery department of “Happy Hospi-tal”. Dr. O. Rderplacer writes a referral which contains all necessary information and sends it to the surgery department of “Happy Hospital”. This includes existing x-rays and reports as well as lab results. He furhter aks for a copy of the report to be sent to the patient.

### Request for Results from earlier
The players are:

* Dr. O. Rderplacer who is a GP in group practice “Happy doctors”
* Surgery department at “Happy Hospital”
* Patient: Mr. S. Ufferer who was in “Happy Hospital” for surgery 2 or 3 years ago

Dr. O. Rderplacer requests the discharche letter from "Happy Hospital".

<i>Although one might prefer a name change for the GP (e.g. Dr. R. Equester; paying tribute to the fact that in general language it is a request rather than an order), we stay with the name of the GP as Dr. O. Rderplacer: with regard to the author, there is no conceptual difference between communication request, referral and order.<i>
