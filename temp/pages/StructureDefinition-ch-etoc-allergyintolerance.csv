Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference.

","Specific substance or pharmaceutical product considered to be responsible for event","Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product) considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.","Coding of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product) with a terminology capable of triggering decision support should be used wherever possible.  The 'code' element allows for the use of a specific substance or pharmaceutical product, or a group or class of substances. In the case of an allergy or intolerance to a class of substances, (for example, ""penicillins""), the 'reaction.substance' element could be used to code the specific substance that was identified as having caused the reaction (for example, ""amoxycillin"").
