<h3 id="request-for-results-from-earlier">Request for Results from earlier</h3>
<p>The players are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dr. O. Rderplacer who is a GP in group practice “Happy doctors”</li>
  <li>Surgery department at “Happy Hospital”</li>
  <li>Patient: Mr. S. Ufferer who was in “Happy Hospital” for surgery 2 or 3 years ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. O. Rderplacer requests the discharche letter from “Happy Hospital”.</p>

<p><i>Although one might prefer a name change for the GP (e.g. Dr. R. Equester; paying tribute to the fact that in general language it is a request rather than an order), we stay with the name of the GP as Dr. O. Rderplacer: with regard to the author, there is no conceptual difference between communication request, referral and order.<i></i></i></p>
