<p>The players are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Referrer: Dr. O. Rderplacer, who is a family physician in the Happy Doctors group practice.</li>
  <li>Hospital: Surgical department of Happy Hospital</li>
  <li>Patient: Ms. S. Ufferer, who is in need of surgical intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Patient S. Ufferer has an appointment with Dr. O. Rderplacer who agrees with the patient that an operation is necessary, to be performed in the Surgical Department of Happy Hospital. Dr. O. Rderplacer writes a referral containing all the necessary information and sends it to Happy Hospital. This includes existing x-rays and reports, as well as lab results. He also asks that a copy of the report be sent to the patient.</p>

<h3 id="requesting-results-from-earlier">Requesting results from earlier.</h3>
<p>The players are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dr. O. Rderplacer, who is a family physician in the Happy Doctors group practice.</li>
  <li>Surgical department in Happy Hospital.</li>
  <li>Patient: Ms. S. Ufferer, who was at Happy Hospital 2 or 3 years ago for an operative procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. O. Rderplacer requests the discharge report from Happy Hospital.</p>

<p><i>Although the primary care physician could be called something else (e.g., Dr. R. Equester; since in common usage it is a request rather than an order), we will stick with calling the primary care physician Dr. O. Rderplacer: conceptually, there is no difference between requesting a report, a referral, and an order (laboratory. radiology, etc.).<i></i></i></p>
